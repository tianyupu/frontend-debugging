# Frontend Debugging

A brown bag on debugging the web frontend. (May 2015)

## View online

[Hosted on heroku](http://frontend-debugging.herokuapp.com/)

## Running locally

1. Install `node` and `npm`, and then run `npm install` in the root of the
directory.
1. Once that's done, start up a local server to view the slides by typing
`npm start`.
1. Navigate to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Editing slides
1. Update `index.html` and `debugging.md` as needed: `index.html` controls the
scripts on the page, and `debugging.md` controls the content of the actual
slides.
1. No need to restart the local server -- it will watch for your changes and
refresh accordingly, even if you have
[http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) open when edits are made.
